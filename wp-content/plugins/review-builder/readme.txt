#### Why should I use Review Builder?

It's a proven fact that customers prefer to read reviews on company websites rather than magazines, newspapers or on social media; so including reviews on your site is important. Adding reviews section to your site is a super-effective way of getting instant feedback from your readers, on the quality of your site content. Whether it's a blog post, web page, image or whatever piece/element of your website that you want to be rated. Showing average star rating score helps customers to get an idea of reviews at a glance. It's like a short summary of a long article, made on the product in graphical view. Even the reputation of a company may be depending on the reviews and star ratings it has on its page. So, it's obvious that reviews are like some kind of indicators of a product or service you're offering. Also, the star rating and review system is the best way to gather feedback about products.
