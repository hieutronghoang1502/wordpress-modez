If you have a landing page for your product that is not a WooCommerce product page, then this plugin is perfect for you. It allows you to insert the reviews of the product you are promoting anywhere you like. It also inserts the product Schema into the page, allowing you to display the rating directly from Google’s search results.

<h3>Take control of your product reviews</h3>
WooCommerce product pages are great, but sometimes you have to promote products from a normal post or page. In the past you would have to manually copy/paste your product reviews, but SIP Reviews Shortcode for WooCommerce is here to the rescue! Not only it will show a live feed of your product reviews, it will also insert Schema and show your product rating directly from Google’s search results.

<h3>Key Features</h3>

The plugin is packaged with the following features:

* **Display product reviews anywhere with a shortcode**.
* **Display product reviews anywhere via widget**.
* **Insert product Schema (name, price, rating) anywhere with a shortcode**.
* **Customisable style.** The plugin comes with a color picker for all elements so you can easily match your theme in a few minutes.
